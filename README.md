# PhDAssign
 PhD Student assignment for grad school with both students and PIs providing their choices in order of preference
 For this to work, the Guide (PI) chooses students and vice versa in order of preference. Based on this input, the algorithm tries to assign best matches (with a cap on highest number of students any PI can take).
